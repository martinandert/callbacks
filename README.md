## Contributing

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo and `make install`.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `make test`.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or are fixing a bug, we need a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
